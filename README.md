# ChemAI-Optima
AI-Driven Generative Modeling for Chemical Process Optimization and Image-Based Anomaly Detection
This project uses GANs for generative modeling, Autoencoders for anomaly detection, and RandomForest for chemical process optimization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Used
- Generative AI (GANs)
- Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection
- Chemical Process Optimization
- Data Processing (NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV)
- Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## üìÇ Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the cement slump and CIFAR-10 datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration.
- `src/`: Source code for models and data processing.
- `results/`: Saved models and outputs.

## Dataset Information
The following datasets are included in the `data/` directory:
1. **Cement Slump Dataset** (`cement_slump.csv`):
   - Contains chemical process data for cement production.
   - Used for process optimization.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset** (`cifar-10/`):
   - Contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
   - Used for anomaly detection.
