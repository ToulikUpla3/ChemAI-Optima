# ChemAI-Optima
AI-Driven Generative Modeling for Chemical Process Optimization and Image-Based Anomaly Detection
This project uses GANs for generative modeling, Autoencoders for anomaly detection, and RandomForest for chemical process optimization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Used
- Generative AI (GANs)
- Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection
- Chemical Process Optimization
- Data Processing (NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV)
- Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## üìÇ Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the cement slump and CIFAR-10 datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration.
- `src/`: Source code for models and data processing.
- `results/`: Saved models and outputs.

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Driven-Chemical-Process-Optimization.git!
